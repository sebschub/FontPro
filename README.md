FontPro source distribution
===========================

FontPro provides scripts that automatically generate all necessary
files to use Adobe Minion Pro, Adobe Myriad Pro and Adobe Cronos Pro
with (pdf)latex.  In contrast to other solutions, the supplied LaTeX
packages provide extensive math support in the case of Minion and
Myriad.  The swash letters of CronosPro can be used as `mathcal`
symbols with MyriadPro's math (option `crswash`).


Requirements
------------

The scripts need the [LCDF Typetools](http://www.lcdf.org/type/) to
run.  Version 2.85 or later is required; certain recent font versions
need version 2.99 or later.  Furthermore, standard Unix tools such as
`bash`, `sed` and `ed` are required and the following LaTeX packages,
which are currently included in a complete TeXLive or MikTeX
installation, are necessary:

* fontinst v1.925 or better
* fontaxes package
* MnSymbol for MinionPro, MdSymbol for MyriadPro
* fltpoint package
* tabfigures package (optional)
* fontware package (usually, but not always, comes with your Tex
  distribution)


Supported font styles
---------------------

For the basic set-up (`smallfamily` LaTeX package option), the regular
and bold face font are required together with their respective italic
version.  This set-up can be extended with the semibold face and its
italic (`medfamily` option), and even further with the medium face and
its italic (`fullfamily` option).

Furthermore, the optical sizes Caption, Text, Subhead and Display are
supported independently from the set-up above (`opticals` option).
Here, every font file has to be available in every optical size.

For Myriad Pro, also the light and the black weight can be used (see
documentation).

Extended or condensed font styles are not supported.


Building
--------

The following describes the build process. Here, `$` at the beginning
of the line indicates the shell command prompt. Under Windows,
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) is required; either install the LCDF
type tools in Cygwin from source or install the
`texlive-font-fontutils` package.

1. Put the sources in a folder.
2. Create an `otf` directory in that folder and copy your OpenType
   font files into the `otf` directory:

        $ mkdir otf
        $ cp /some/path/*.otf otf

   MinionPro and MyriadPro font files normally follow the naming
   scheme assumed in the scripts. Make sure that the CronosPro files
   are of the form

        $FONT-$WEIGHT$SHAPE$OPTICAL.otf

   resulting in for example

        CronosPro-BoldCapt.otf
        CronosPro-BoldDisp.otf
        CronosPro-BoldItCapt.otf
        CronosPro-BoldItDisp.otf
        CronosPro-BoldIt.otf
        CronosPro-BoldItSubh.otf
        CronosPro-Bold.otf
        CronosPro-BoldSubh.otf
        CronosPro-Capt.otf
        CronosPro-Disp.otf
        CronosPro-ItCapt.otf
        CronosPro-ItDisp.otf
        CronosPro-It.otf
        CronosPro-ItSubh.otf
        CronosPro-Regular.otf
        CronosPro-SemiboldCapt.otf
        CronosPro-SemiboldDisp.otf
        CronosPro-SemiboldItCapt.otf
        CronosPro-SemiboldItDisp.otf
        CronosPro-SemiboldIt.otf
        CronosPro-SemiboldItSubh.otf
        CronosPro-Semibold.otf
        CronosPro-SemiboldSubh.otf
        CronosPro-Subh.otf 

3. Run the main script `makeall`:

        $ ./scripts/makeall $FONT [options]

   Currently, `$FONT` can be MinionPro, MyriadPro or CronosPro.

   `makeall` has some options, which normally you do not need to use.

        --verbose            show warning messages from otftotfm
        --quiet              omit these messages (default)
        --pack=<glyph-list>  explicitly name the glyph list

   The glyph list of the last option is used to reduce the number of
   generated files and the size of the map file. This speeds up the
   compilation slightly but does not affect the output. The default
   behaviour without the `--pack` option is to use the glyph list that
   fits to your font version; if this glyph list is not available in
   the scripts folder, it can be generated using
   `generate-glyph-list.sh` _after_ a successful build. The `--pack`
   option can only be used if all you font files are of the same
   version.

   Furthermore, you can specify which metrics to create:

        --smallcaps          create small caps metrics (default)
        --nosmallcaps        turn --smallcaps off
        --swash              create swash metrics (default)
        --noswash            turn --swash off
        --greek              create greek metrics (default)
        --nogreek            turn --greek off
        --cyrillic           create cyrillic metrics (default)
        --nocyrillic         turn --cyrillic off
        --vietnamese         create vietnamese metrics (default)
        --novietnamese       turn --vietnamese off
        --expanded           create expanded metrics for pdftex
        --noexpanded         turn --expanded off (default)
        --kern               add some missing kerning pairs (default)
        --nokern             use the original Adobe kerning
        --ligatures          provide standard ligatures (default)
        --noligatures        provide no ligatures
        --wide-spacing       increase the sidebearings of quote glyphs
        --narrow-spacing     turn --wide-spacing off (default)

   The `--expanded` option allows to use the font expansion feature of
   microtype even with pdftex in dvi mode but increases the run-time
   of `makeall` and the number of produced files considerably.


Installing
----------

Under Linux-like environments, use the following commands to install
the font:

1. Run the `install` script. You can specify the directory where the
   files should be put. The default is `$TEXMFLOCAL`.

        $ ./scripts/install /usr/local/share/texmf

   (If you use a TeX distribution older than 2005 which does not
   follow TDS v1.1, uncomment the "old directory folders" in the
   install script!)

2. Add `$FONT.map` to the default font map files by

        $ updmap --enable Map=$FONT.map

   For a system-wide installation, use `updmap-sys` instead of
   `updmap`.

Under Windows with MikTeX, do the following: 

1. Run in the Cygwin Bash

        $ ./scripts/install /cygdrive/c/path/to/Miktex

   where `c/path/to/Miktex` is the path to the Miktex installation
   tree of choice.

2. In the Windows prompt, issue

        initexmf -u
        initexmf --admin --edit-config-file updmap

   Add the following in the editor:

        Map $FONT.map

   and save. Afterwards, run

        initexmf --mkmaps


Cleaning up of the building folder
----------------------------------

If you want to install another font, it is recommended to do a

    $ ./scripts/clean

or to start from a fresh building folder.


Usage
-----

Use the FONT with

    \usepackage{FONT}

By default, the MinionPro package modifies the default serif and the
main math fonts; the MyriadPro and CronosPro change only the sans
serif font. In the latter case, if you want to use the respective font
as your main document's font, you probably have to set

    \renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

All valid options of the font packages are included in the
documentation, which is provided in the `doc` folder and which can
also be generated _after_ installing with

    latex $FONT.dtx

The `dtx` file resides in the `tex` folder.

If you get errors about insufficient memory you might need to increase
the values of `font_mem_size` and `font_max` in your TeX
configuration. For most distributions, these can be changed in the
file `texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf`. For MiKTeX the file is called
`miktex.ini`.
